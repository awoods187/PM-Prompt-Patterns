# Few-Shot Example Patterns

**Complexity**: ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate

ðŸš§ **Coming Soon**

This section will include production patterns for few-shot learning and example selection.

Topics to be covered:
- Optimal shot count by task type
- Example selection strategies (diversity vs specificity)
- Example quality vs quantity trade-offs
- Example rotation for production systems
- Synthetic example generation
- Production metrics showing impact of shot count

See [TODO.md](../TODO.md) for planned content.

Check back soon or [contribute](../CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## Quick Reference

**Shot Count Guidelines**:
- **0-shot**: Model has strong priors (summarization, translation)
- **1-shot**: Simple tasks, output format clarification
- **3-shot**: Complex tasks, demonstrate edge cases
- **5-shot**: High accuracy requirements (our sweet spot for classification)
- **10+ shot**: Specialized domains, unusual patterns

See [prompt_design_principles.md](../prompt_design_principles.md#few-shot-learning-patterns) for detailed examples and production metrics.
