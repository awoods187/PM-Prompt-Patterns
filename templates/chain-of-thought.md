# Chain-of-Thought Prompting

**Complexity**: ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate

ðŸš§ **Coming Soon**

This section will include production-tested chain-of-thought patterns for complex reasoning tasks.

Topics to be covered:
- When to use chain-of-thought reasoning
- Basic CoT patterns
- Advanced CoT techniques (tree of thought, self-consistency)
- Cost implications and optimization
- Production examples with metrics

See [TODO.md](../TODO.md) for planned content.

Check back soon or [contribute](../CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## Quick Reference

Chain-of-thought is most effective for:
- Complex multi-step reasoning
- Ambiguous or nuanced decisions
- High-stakes classifications
- Debugging misclassifications

**Trade-off**: 2-3x token cost for improved accuracy on complex tasks.

See [PROMPT_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md](../PROMPT_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md#chain-of-thought-reasoning) for basic patterns.
