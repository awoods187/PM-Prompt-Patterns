## 📊 Metrics Comparison

### Before
- **Length:** 452 lines (~2,200 words)
- **Word count:** Exceeded 1,000-word guideline by 120%
- **Time to value:** ~3-5 minutes of reading
- **Enterprise sections:** Partial (missing security, support, maintenance)
- **Scannable:** Moderate (some wall-of-text sections)

### After
- **Length:** 288 lines (~950 words)
- **Word count:** Within 1,000-word guideline
- **Time to value:** <2 minutes to understand, <5 minutes operational

## 📦 Content to Move to Separate Documentation

The following content was extracted from README to maintain focus. Create these files:

### 1. `docs/api-examples.md` - Detailed Code Examples
**Why:** Code examples beyond basic usage belong in API docs
**Content to include:**
- Comprehensive `ai_models` package usage
- Advanced filtering examples
- Multi-model orchestration patterns
- Error handling patterns
- Integration with external systems

**Estimated length:** 300-400 lines

**Example structure:**
```markdown
# AI Models API Documentation

## Basic Usage
[Examples from current README]

## Advanced Filtering
[Cost tier filtering]
[Capability-based selection]
[Provider-specific queries]

## Production Patterns
[Retry logic]
[Fallback strategies]
[Cost tracking]

## Integration Examples
[FastAPI integration]
[Async patterns]
[Batch processing]
```

---

### 2. `docs/learning-path.md` - Structured Learning Curriculum
**Why:** Week-by-week learning path is valuable but too detailed for README
**Content to include:**
- 4-week curriculum (from old README)
- Prerequisites for each week
- Success criteria
- Practice exercises
- Advanced topics (weeks 5-8)

**Estimated length:** 200-300 lines

**Example structure:**
```markdown
# Learning Path: Prompt Engineering to Production

## Prerequisites
[Skill assessment checklist]

## Week 1: Fundamentals
**Goal:** Understand core prompt design principles
**Activities:**
1. Read PROMPT_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md
2. Try 3 basic prompts
3. Learn model selection

**Success Criteria:**
- Can explain prompt structure
- Understand when to use each model
- Successfully run 3 examples

## Week 2-4: [Similar structure]

## Advanced Path (Weeks 5-8)
[For production deployment]
```

- Common failure patterns
- Integration with evaluation frameworks

**Estimated length:** 400-500 lines

**Move from:** Old README lines 246-276

---

### 4. `docs/model-cascading-patterns.md` - Implementation Details
**Why:** ASCII diagram is great but detailed implementation belongs in docs
**Content to include:**
- Complete cascading architecture diagram
- Implementation code examples

- Cost tracking implementation
- Performance tuning

**Estimated length:** 300-400 lines

**Move from:** Old README lines 76-108 (expand with implementation)

---

### 5. `docs/performance.md` - Benchmarks & Architecture
**Why:** Referenced in new README but doesn't exist yet
**Content to include:**
- Detailed benchmark methodology
- Latency breakdowns by operation
- Scalability testing results
- Architecture diagrams
- Load testing scenarios
- Cost vs performance tradeoffs

**Estimated length:** 400-500 lines

---

### 6. `CHANGELOG.md` - Release History
**Why:** Analytics reorganization notes don't belong in README
**Content to include:**
- October 2025: Analytics category reorganization
- October 2025: AI models refactor
- October 2025: CI/CD enhancement
- Version history with migration guides

**Estimated length:** 200-300 lines

**Move from:** Old README lines 421-433

## 📅 Maintenance Schedule

### Dynamic Sections (Require Regular Updates)

| Section | Location | Frequency | Owner | Update Trigger |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Model Pricing** | README, ai_models/definitions/ | Monthly | Maintainer | Provider announces pricing change |
| **Model Specs** | ai_models/definitions/ | As released | Maintainer | New model version released |
| **CI/CD Badges** | README | Automated | GitHub Actions | Continuous |
| **Security Scans** | README Security section | Weekly | Dependabot | Automated |
| **Dependencies** | pyproject.toml | Weekly | Dependabot | Automated |
| **Last Updated** | README Project Status | Monthly | Maintainer | Significant change |

### Static Sections (Update Only When Changed)

| Section | Review Frequency | Update Trigger |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Why This Exists | Quarterly | Value prop changes |
| Quick Start | Quarterly | Installation process changes |
| Repository Structure | As needed | Major refactors |
| Contributing | Annually | Process changes |
| License | Never | (Static) |

### Recommended Maintenance Workflow

**Monthly (1st of month):**
1. Verify model pricing against provider docs
2. Update "Last Updated" date if changes made
3. Check for broken links
4. Review GitHub Issues for documentation gaps

**Quarterly (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct):**
1. Review all metrics for accuracy
2. Update screenshots if UI changed
3. Verify all code examples still work
4. Update "Why This Exists" if value prop evolved

**Annually:**
1. Major documentation audit
2. Reorganize structure if needed
3. Update learning path based on feedback
4. Review and update CONTRIBUTING.md
