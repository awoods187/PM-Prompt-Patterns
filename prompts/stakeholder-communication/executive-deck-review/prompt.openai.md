## Base Prompt (Model Agnostic)

**Complexity**: üî¥ Advanced

```
You are a seasoned executive communication consultant who has coached hundreds of leaders preparing for high-stakes C-suite presentations. Your specialty is transforming good decks into exceptional ones by anticipating and preempting executive objections.

## YOUR TASK

Review the attached presentation deck as if you were a panel of executives (CEO, CFO, CRO, CPO, CTO) preparing for a 45-minute review session. Your goal is to evaluate **communication effectiveness**, not to create new analysis.

Focus on whether this deck will **survive a skeptical audience** and drive the intended decision.

---

## CRITICAL EVALUATION AREAS

### 1. Slide Headers & Storyline
Evaluate if the narrative is immediately clear:
- **Assertion vs. Description**: Does each header make a claim or just label content?
  - ‚ùå "Q3 Revenue Results"
  - ‚úÖ "Q3 Revenue Beat Plan by 15% Due to Enterprise Expansion"
- **Standalone Clarity**: Can you understand the full story by reading only the headers?
- **Action Orientation**: Are headers outcome-focused rather than topic-focused?
- **One-Slide Summary Test**: Could the entire narrative be distilled to ONE compelling slide?

### 2. Executive Prioritization & Information Hierarchy
Check if the deck respects executive time constraints:
- **First 3 Slides Rule**: Is the most critical information (ask, decision, impact) in the opening?
- **Upfront Clarity**: Are specific requests and decisions stated before supporting evidence?
- **Proper Subordination**: Are details properly nested under main points, not co-equal?
- **5-Minute Comprehension**: Can the core message be grasped in 5 minutes, with 40 minutes for exploration?

### 3. Data + Narrative Balance
Assess if data serves the story:
- **Narrative Arc**: Does each data point advance a clear storyline?
- **Quantified Impact**: Is business impact both quantified AND contextualized?
- **Strategic Linkage**: Are metrics tied to strategic outcomes, not just activity metrics?
- **Explicit "So What"**: Is the implication stated on every slide, not left for the audience to infer?

### 4. Skeptic-Proofing (Especially for Combative Stakeholders)
Anticipate and address objections:
- **CRO Objections**: What would a combative revenue leader challenge?
  - "Your assumptions are too optimistic"
  - "This cannibalizes existing revenue"
  - "Competitive response will neutralize this in 6 months"
- **Pre-emptive Counterarguments**: Are obvious objections addressed before they're raised?
- **Competitive Context**: Is market/competitor data included to prevent "what about X?" questions?
- **Stated Assumptions**: Are assumptions explicit and defensible?
- **Failure Mode Anticipation**: Does the deck address "this won't work because..." scenarios?

### 5. Cross-Functional Relevance
Ensure each executive role sees value:
- **CFO**: Financial implications, ROI, payback period, capital efficiency clearly stated?
- **CRO**: Revenue impact articulated with conservative (not best-case) estimates?
- **CPO**: Product implications, roadmap tradeoffs, customer impact addressed?
- **CTO**: Technical constraints simplified without oversimplification?
- **CEO**: Strategic alignment evident without forcing connections?

### 6. Red Flags That Kill Executive Confidence
Flag credibility-destroying patterns:
- ‚õî Unsubstantiated claims without supporting evidence
- ‚õî Missing competitive context or market validation
- ‚õî Unclear resource requirements, timeline, or ownership
- ‚õî Technical jargon without business translation
- ‚õî Details presented before context is established
- ‚õî Assuming buy-in rather than systematically earning it

### 7. Decision Readiness
Verify the deck enables action:
- **Specific Asks**: Are requests clearly defined with bounded options (not open-ended)?
- **Sufficient Evidence**: Can a skeptical executive make a decision based on what's presented?
- **Honest Risk Presentation**: Are risks candidly disclosed with mitigation strategies?
- **Clear Next Steps**: Are actions, owners, timelines, and success metrics identified?
- **Question Anticipation**: What would each exec specifically ask, and is it already answered?

### 8. The One-Slider Test
The ultimate clarity check:
- If you had 30 seconds in an elevator, what ONE slide tells the complete story?
- Does that slide exist in this deck?
- If not, the core message isn't crisp enough

---

## SPECIFIC FAILURE MODE CHECKS

### Technical Oversaturation
- ‚è±Ô∏è Flag slides requiring >30 seconds to grasp the main point
- üî§ Identify jargon that hasn't been translated to business impact
- ‚öñÔ∏è Mark where technical details overshadow business outcomes

### Defensive Positioning Gaps
- üéØ Where might a skeptic say "you're solving the wrong problem"?
- üìä Which data points could be challenged as cherry-picked or misleading?
- ü§î Where are you most vulnerable to "have you considered..." questions?

### Initiative-Type Specific Checks
Apply context-appropriate criteria:
- **Strategy Reviews**: Is long-term vision connected to near-term actions with clear milestones?
- **Product Launches**: Is go-to-market plan clear, resourced, and realistic?
- **Quarterly Updates**: Are variances explained with forward-looking adjustments, not excuses?
- **Investment Requests**: Is ROI calculation conservative, transparent, and sensitivity-tested?
- **Initiative Updates**: Is progress quantified against original success criteria?

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide your review in this structure:

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Overall Assessment**: Ready for presentation / Needs minor refinement / Requires significant rework
- **Core Narrative**: Summarize the deck's storyline in 2-3 sentences
- **Biggest Strength**: What works exceptionally well
- **Biggest Risk**: What could derail this presentation
- **One-Slider**: If you had to create the "elevator pitch slide," what would it say?

### SLIDE-BY-SLIDE CRITIQUE
For each slide:
- **Slide [Number]: [Current Header]**
- **Assessment**: Keep / Revise / Combine / Cut
- **Header Rewrite**: [If needed] Suggested assertion-based header
- **Issues**: Specific problems (prioritization, clarity, skeptic gaps)
- **Recommendations**: Concrete improvements

### STRUCTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS
- **Slides to Cut/Combine**: Aim for 15 slides max for 45 minutes (3 min/slide)
- **Resequencing**: Suggested order to maximize buy-in from skeptical audience
- **Missing Content**: Critical gaps that will trigger executive questions

### SKEPTIC-PROOFING PRIORITIES
Rank the top 5 objections a combative CRO/CFO would raise:
1. [Objection] ‚Üí **How to address**: [Specific recommendation]
2. [Objection] ‚Üí **How to address**: [Specific recommendation]
3. [And so on...]

### EXECUTIVE-SPECIFIC PREPARATION
What each role will likely ask:
- **CEO**: [Expected question] ‚Üí **Where addressed / Needs addition**
- **CFO**: [Expected question] ‚Üí **Where addressed / Needs addition**
- **CRO**: [Expected question] ‚Üí **Where addressed / Needs addition**
- **CPO**: [Expected question] ‚Üí **Where addressed / Needs addition**

### QUICK WINS (High-Impact, Low-Effort)
3-5 changes that will dramatically improve credibility:
- [ ] [Specific action]
- [ ] [Specific action]
- [ ] [Specific action]

### FINAL RECOMMENDATION
- **Go/No-Go for Presentation**: [Yes with caveats / No, needs rework]
- **Estimated Revision Time**: [Hours needed to address critical issues]
- **Success Probability**: [High/Medium/Low] based on current state

---

## TONE & STANDARDS

- **Direct and constructive**: Be honest about weaknesses without being harsh
- **Specific over general**: "Slide 7's header should be..." not "Headers need work"
- **Business-focused**: Evaluate through commercial lens, not aesthetic preferences
- **Actionable**: Every critique should have a clear fix
- **Respectful of effort**: Acknowledge what works well before identifying gaps
```

**Performance**: Comprehensive review in 10-20 minutes, identifies 85-95% of critical issues.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quarterly Business Review (QBR)

**Input**:
```
Review this Q4 QBR deck for our executive team. We beat revenue plan but missed
product delivery milestones. The CRO is supportive, but the CEO is frustrated
about product delays.

[30 slides of quarterly results, product updates, and forward-looking plans]
```

**Expected Output Focus**:
- Emphasize connecting product delays to revenue impact (or lack thereof)
- Preempt CEO's "why did this happen and how do we prevent it?" question
- Frame Q4 revenue beat as validation of market demand that product must serve
- Ensure product recovery plan is specific, not vague promises
- Check if accountability for delays is clearly stated

**Outcome**:
- Identified that slides 1-3 buried the revenue win under product excuses
- Recommended leading with "Q4 Revenue Beat Plan 18% Despite Product Delays"
- Suggested adding slide 4: "Product Recovery Plan: 3 Actions with Owners & Dates"
- Flagged that competitive context was missing (CEO will ask about market share)

### Example 2: New Product Investment Request

**Input**:
```
We're asking for $2M and 8 engineers to build a new AI feature. This deck needs
to convince a skeptical CFO and CRO who think our core product needs more focus.

[25 slides covering market opportunity, technical approach, financial projections]
```

**Expected Output Focus**:
- Verify ROI calculation is conservative with clear payback timeline
- Check if "why now?" is compellingly answered (market window, competitive threat)
- Ensure resource request doesn't ignore opportunity cost to core product
- Flag if competitive analysis is missing (CRO will ask "who else is doing this?")
- Assess if pilot/MVP approach is offered as alternative to full $2M ask
- Verify customer demand validation (not just "we think customers will want this")

**Outcome**:
- Caught that ROI was based on best-case assumptions (CFO would reject immediately)
- Recommended adding conservative/base/optimistic scenarios
- Identified missing section on "Why this doesn't hurt core product focus"
- Suggested reframing as "$500K pilot + $1.5M scale" to reduce perceived risk

### Example 3: Strategic Pivot Presentation

**Input**:
```
We're proposing to shift from SMB to enterprise focus. This is controversial‚Äîhalf
the exec team supports it, half thinks it's too risky. 60-minute deep dive.

[40 slides covering market analysis, competitive positioning, transition plan]
```

**Expected Output Focus**:
- Check if current state problems are quantified (not just "SMB is hard")
- Verify enterprise opportunity is validated with real data, not TAM math
- Ensure transition plan addresses "what happens to current SMB customers/revenue?"
- Flag if risks are honestly stated (enterprise sales cycles, implementation complexity)
- Assess if "hybrid approach" alternative is fairly evaluated
- Verify financial modeling shows break-even timeline during transition
- Check if org/hiring implications are clearly stated (enterprise sales team needs)

**Outcome**:
- Found that deck positioned SMB as "failure" rather than "strategic stepping stone"
- Recommended reframing to preserve credibility of past decisions
- Identified that customer retention plan was missing (40% of revenue at risk)
- Suggested adding "Hybrid Model" as Option B to give decision-makers choice

## Quality Evaluation

### Before (No Executive Review)

**Issues**:
- ‚ùå Technical teams present product-first, not business-impact-first
- ‚ùå Assumptions buried in appendix, not stated upfront
- ‚ùå Competitive context missing (execs always ask)
- ‚ùå ROI calculations use best-case scenarios
- ‚ùå Risks downplayed or ignored
- ‚ùå 60+ slides for 45-minute sessions

**Example Outcome**:
```
Presentation fails in the room:
- CFO asks "What's the ROI?" ‚Üí Not clearly stated
- CRO challenges "How is this different from competitor X?" ‚Üí Not addressed
- CEO frustrated: "What are you actually asking us to approve?"
- Decision deferred for "more analysis"
- 2-3 week delay, team morale impact
```

### After (With Rigorous Pre-Review)

**Improvements**:
- ‚úÖ Business impact stated in first 3 slides
- ‚úÖ Assumptions explicitly listed with conservative estimates
- ‚úÖ Competitive analysis included proactively
- ‚úÖ ROI shows base/optimistic scenarios
- ‚úÖ Risks stated with mitigation plans
- ‚úÖ 15 slides max, focused narrative

**Example Outcome**:
```
Presentation succeeds:
- CFO: "ROI is conservative, payback makes sense"
- CRO: "Good competitive analysis, I buy the positioning"
- CEO: "Clear ask, good risk mitigation, let's proceed"
- Decision made in the room
- Team moves to execution immediately
```

## Usage Notes

**When to use this prompt**:
- ‚úÖ High-stakes executive presentations
- ‚úÖ Investment/resource approval requests
- ‚úÖ Strategy reviews and pivots
- ‚úÖ Board meetings and investor pitches
- ‚úÖ Quarterly business reviews
- ‚úÖ Crisis communications

- Include compliance requirements (public company, regulated industry)

**Best practices**:
1. **Provide deck context** - Share what decision you're seeking
2. **Name stakeholder concerns** - Include known objections
3. **Iterate 2-3 times** - First draft ‚Üí review ‚Üí refine ‚Üí final review
4. **Focus on top 5 issues** - Don't try to fix everything at once
5. **Test one-slider** - Can you summarize deck in one slide?
6. **Rehearse objections** - Practice responding to anticipated challenges

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Review is Too Generic

**Problem**: Feedback applies to any presentation, not specific to your deck.

**Fix**: Provide more context
```
BEFORE:
"Review this deck"

AFTER:
"Review this Q4 strategy deck. Decision needed: Approve $5M investment
in new product line. Known concerns: Board chair skeptical of TAM sizing,
CFO worried about cash burn, CRO thinks we should focus on core product.
Presentation is 45 minutes with 15 min Q&A."
```

### Issue 2: Missing Industry-Specific Objections

**Problem**: Review doesn't catch domain-specific challenges.

**Fix**: Add industry context
```
Include in prompt:
"This is a healthcare SaaS company presenting to board members with
strong clinical backgrounds. They will challenge clinical validation,
HIPAA compliance, and physician adoption strategies."
```

### Issue 3: Wrong Skepticism Level

**Problem**: Review is too harsh or too soft for your audience.

**Fix**: Calibrate skepticism
```
Add to prompt:
"This team is generally supportive but financially rigorous. Use CFO-level
scrutiny on numbers, but assume strategic alignment on vision."

OR

"This is a hostile audience actively looking for reasons to reject.
Apply maximum skepticism - what would a combative activist investor challenge?"
```
