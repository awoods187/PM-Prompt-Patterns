# Enterprise README Generator & Optimizer (OpenAI Optimized)

**Provider:** OpenAI
**Optimizations:** Function calling, JSON mode, structured outputs

**Complexity**: 🟡 Intermediate

## OpenAI-Specific Features

This variant is optimized for OpenAI models with:
- **Function calling** for guaranteed structured output
- **JSON mode** for valid JSON responses
- **Parallel tool calls** for batch processing
- **Reproducible results** with seed parameter

## Usage with Function Calling

```python
from ai_models import get_prompt
import openai

prompt = get_prompt("developing-internal-tools/enterprise-readme-generator", provider="openai")

# Define function schema for structured output
function_schema = {
    "name": "process_prompt",
    "description": "Process the prompt and return structured output",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "result": {"type": "string", "description": "The processed result"},
            "confidence": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0.0, "maximum": 1.0},
            "reasoning": {"type": "string", "description": "Step-by-step reasoning"}
        },
        "required": ["result", "confidence", "reasoning"]
    }
}

# Use with GPT-4o or GPT-4o-mini
response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Your input here"}
    ],
    functions=[function_schema],
    function_call={"name": "process_prompt"},
    temperature=0.0  # Deterministic output
)

result = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.function_call.arguments)
```

## Usage with JSON Mode

```python
response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Your input here"}
    ],
    response_format={"type": "json_object"},
    temperature=0.0
)

result = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Base Prompt (Model Agnostic)

**Complexity**: 🟡 Intermediate

```
You are a technical documentation expert specializing in enterprise-grade README files that serve multiple stakeholder audiences. Your goal is to transform or create README documentation that balances professional clarity with accessibility.

## YOUR TASK

Improve the provided README (or create one from project description) to serve multiple stakeholders while maintaining enterprise standards and professional tone.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. Progressive Information Disclosure

Structure content in layers:
- **Level 1 (Executive Summary)**: Business value in 2-3 sentences
- **Level 2 (Quick Start)**: Developer operational in <5 minutes
- **Level 3 (Developer Details)**: Complete implementation guide
- **Level 4 (Deep Dive)**: Links to extensive documentation

### 2. Audience-Adaptive Sections

Mark sections by primary audience:
- 🎯 **All Audiences**: Project overview, status, why it exists
- 💼 **Stakeholders**: Business value, roadmap, success metrics
- 🔧 **Developers**: Technical setup, API, contributing guide
- 🏗️ **DevOps**: Deployment, monitoring, scaling, operations

### 3. Conciseness Standards

Apply strict word limits:
- Project description: Maximum 50 words
- Section introductions: Maximum 25 words
- Step instructions: Maximum 15 words per step
- Total README: Maximum 1000 words (link to docs for more)

---

## REQUIRED STRUCTURE

### Essential Sections (All Projects)

**1. Project Header**
```markdown
# Project Name
[1-2 sentence description including business value]
```

---

## WRITING RULES

### Anti-Verbose Patterns

**AVOID** ❌:
- "This section will explain..." → Jump directly to content
- Philosophical discussions → State facts only
- Redundant explanations → Trust reader intelligence
- Wall-of-text paragraphs → Use lists and tables
- Exhaustive feature lists → Top 5 + link to full list

**USE INSTEAD** ✅:
- Direct, actionable language
- Visual hierarchy (headers, bullets, tables)
- Code examples over prose explanations
- Collapsible sections for optional content
- Strategic links to detailed documentation

### Code Block Standards

```language
# Include in every code block:
# - Copy-pasteable commands (no placeholders unless necessary)
# - Expected output when non-obvious
# - Error handling when critical
# - Language specification for syntax highlighting
```

### Formatting Standards

**Visual Hierarchy**:
- Use emoji icons for section headers (sparingly, professionally)
- Maximum 3 header levels in main README flow
- Tables for comparing options or listing parameters
- Collapsible `<details>` for platform-specific or advanced content

**Example Collapsible**:
```markdown
<details>
<summary>Advanced Configuration (Optional)</summary>

[Detailed content here that most users won't need]

</details>
```

---

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Business value clear in first 10 seconds of reading?
- [ ] Developer can start in under 5 minutes?
- [ ] All commands tested on clean system?
- [ ] Stakeholder-friendly summary included?
- [ ] Total length under 1000 words?
- [ ] Complex topics moved to linked documentation?
- [ ] Security/compliance sections addressed?
- [ ] Maintenance metadata included?
- [ ] Visual hierarchy scannable?
- [ ] No redundant or philosophical content?

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide:

1. **Improved README** (complete markdown)
2. **Content to Move**: List of topics to extract into separate docs with suggested filenames
3. **Maintenance Schedule**: Recommended update frequency for dynamic sections
4. **Stakeholder Summary**: 50-word executive summary for enterprise wiki

---

## TONE & STANDARDS

- **Formal but accessible**: Enterprise professional, not academic
- **Action-oriented**: Imperative verbs, clear next steps
- **Assumption of competence**: Don't over-explain basics
- **Respectful of time**: Get to the point immediately
- **Maintainable**: Mark sections requiring periodic updates

Remember: The README represents enterprise work quality. Prioritize clarity and actionability over completeness.
```

**Performance**: Generates comprehensive, multi-stakeholder README in 5-10 minutes.

## Production Patterns

### Pattern 1: Monorepo README Standardization

**Use case**: Create consistent READMEs across multiple projects in a monorepo.

```python
import anthropic
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, List
import yaml

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="...")

def generate_standardized_readme(
    project_name: str,
    project_description: str,
    project_type: str,
    org_standards: Dict
) -> str:
    """
    Generate enterprise-standard README for a project.

    Args:
        project_name: Name of the project
        project_description: What the project does
        project_type: "application" | "library" | "cli" | "data-ml"
        org_standards: Organization-wide standards dict

    Returns:
        Complete README markdown

    Example:
        >>> readme = generate_standardized_readme(
        ...     project_name="customer-analytics-api",

### Pattern 2: README Quality Audit

**Use case**: Audit existing READMEs and provide improvement recommendations.

```python

    MISSING_SECURITY = "Missing security/compliance section"
    NO_CODE_EXAMPLES = "Lacks code examples"
    POOR_HIERARCHY = "Poor visual hierarchy"

@dataclass
class ReadmeAuditResult:
    """Results from README quality audit."""
    project_name: str
    word_count: int
    issues: List[ReadmeIssue]
    quality_score: int  # 0-100

    Example:
        >>> readme = Path("README.md").read_text()
        >>> audit = audit_readme(readme, "my-project")
        >>> print(f"Quality Score: {audit.quality_score}/100")

## Customization Tips

1. **Adjust Verbosity Tolerance**
   - Strict mode: 800-word maximum, minimal optional content
   - Moderate mode: 1000-word maximum, collapsible advanced sections
   - Relaxed mode: 1200-word maximum for complex projects

2. **Industry-Specific Sections**
   - **Healthcare**: Add HIPAA compliance, PHI handling
   - **Finance**: Add PCI-DSS, audit logging, regulatory notes
   - **Open Source**: Add community guidelines, contributor recognition
   - **SaaS**: Add pricing tier compatibility, API rate limits

3. **Audience Emphasis**
   - Developer-heavy: Expand technical setup, minimize business context
   - Executive-heavy: Expand business value, metrics, roadmap
   - DevOps-heavy: Expand deployment, monitoring, scaling sections
   - Balanced: Use progressive disclosure with collapsible sections

4. **Project Maturity Level**
   - **Prototype**: Focus on "why" and vision, minimal setup
   - **Beta**: Emphasize known limitations, feedback channels
   - **Production**: Full enterprise sections, SLAs, support
   - **Legacy**: Add migration path, sunset timeline

5. **Documentation Strategy**
   - **README-only**: Keep everything in README (small projects)
   - **README + docs/**: Extract advanced topics (recommended)
   - **README + wiki**: Use for living documentation
   - **README + external site**: Link to comprehensive docs portal

## Testing Checklist

### Validation Tests

Run these tests before finalizing:

1. **Clean System Test**
   - [ ] Follow quick start on fresh VM/container
   - [ ] Verify each command executes successfully
   - [ ] Confirm expected output matches actual output
   - [ ] Time from start to success (should be <5 min)

2. **Stakeholder Comprehension Test**
   - [ ] Show to non-technical stakeholder
   - [ ] Can they explain project value?
   - [ ] Do they understand status and ownership?
   - [ ] Is executive summary clear?

3. **Developer Onboarding Test**
   - [ ] Give README to new team member
   - [ ] Track time to first contribution
   - [ ] Count clarification questions asked
   - [ ] Measure satisfaction (1-10 scale)

4. **Maintenance Audit**
   - [ ] Identify sections requiring periodic updates
   - [ ] Verify maintenance schedule is realistic
   - [ ] Check if ownership is clear
   - [ ] Confirm update triggers are defined

### Quality Criteria

A high-quality README should achieve:
- **Comprehension**: 90%+ readers understand purpose in <1 minute
- **Actionability**: 95%+ developers operational in <5 minutes
- **Maintainability**: 80%+ sections remain accurate for 6+ months
- **Scannability**: 85%+ can find specific info in <30 seconds
- **Stakeholder satisfaction**: 8+/10 rating from business users

### Common Failure Modes

| Failure | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Generated README Too Generic

**Problem**: Output lacks project-specific details and feels like template.

**Fix**: Provide more context in input
```
BEFORE:
"Generate README for my API project"

AFTER:
"Generate README for order-processing-service:
- Purpose: Process customer orders with payment validation
- Tech: Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Stripe API
- Scale: 500 orders/min, 99.9% uptime SLA
- Team: E-commerce Platform (platform-team@company.com)
- Compliance: PCI-DSS Level 1
- Known issues: Complex Docker setup, API v1 deprecated"
```

### Issue 2: Missing Critical Sections

**Problem**: README lacks security, compliance, or ownership sections.

**Fix**: Explicitly request enterprise sections
```
Add to prompt:
"This is an enterprise project requiring:
- Security section (PCI-DSS compliance, pen test results)
- Ownership section (team name, Slack channel, on-call rotation)
- Maintenance status (update frequency, sunset date)
- Performance metrics (p95 latency, throughput, SLA)"
```

### Issue 3: Quick Start Doesn't Work

**Problem**: Commands fail when tested on clean system.

**Fix**: Provide validated command sequence
```
Include in prompt:
"Quick start must use these exact commands (tested on Ubuntu 22.04):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
sleep 5
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy"}
```

Do not modify these commands - they are verified to work."
```

### Issue 4: README Too Long

**Problem**: Generated README exceeds 1000-word target.

**Fix**: Strengthen conciseness requirement
```
Add to prompt:
"CRITICAL: Maximum 1000 words total. Extract these topics to separate files:
- Architecture details → ARCHITECTURE.md
- Deployment procedures → DEPLOYMENT.md
- API reference → API.md
- Contributing guidelines → CONTRIBUTING.md

In README, provide 2-3 sentence summary + link to detailed doc."
```
