## WORKFLOW STRUCTURE

### Main CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Overall Configuration**:
```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  lint:
    # ...
  test:
    # ...
  security:
    # ...
  build:
    # ...
```

**Job 1: Lint and Format**
```yaml
lint:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - Checkout code
    - Setup Python
    - Cache pip dependencies (key: hashFiles('**/pyproject.toml'))
    - Install dependencies (including black, ruff, isort)
    - Run Black check (--check --diff)
    - Run Ruff linting
    - Run isort check
```

**Job 2: Test (Matrix)**
```yaml
test:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  strategy:
    matrix:
      python-version: ['3.11', '3.12']
  steps:
    - Checkout code
    - Setup Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - Cache pip dependencies
    - Install dependencies with test extras
    - Run pytest with coverage (--cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term)
    - Fail if coverage < 100%
    - Upload coverage artifact (for PR comments)
    - (Optional) Post coverage comment to PR
```

**Job 3: Security Scanning**
```yaml
security:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - Checkout code
    - Setup Python
    - Install security tools (bandit, safety, semgrep, pip-audit)
    - Run Bandit (python security issues)
    - Run Safety (dependency vulnerabilities)
    - Run Semgrep (SAST with Python ruleset)
    - Run pip-audit (supply chain security)
    - Upload results as artifacts
```

**Job 4: Build Verification**
```yaml
build:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - Checkout code
    - Setup Python
    - Install build tools (build, twine)
    - Build wheel and sdist
    - Check package with twine
    - Validate pyproject.toml
    - Test installation in clean venv
```

### Performance Optimizations

**Caching Strategy**:
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/pyproject.toml') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
```

**Path Filtering** (skip CI for docs-only changes):
```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'
      - 'docs/**'
      - '.github/**/*.md'
  pull_request:
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'
      - 'docs/**'
```

**Concurrency Control** (cancel outdated runs):
```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

### Security Best Practices

**Minimal Permissions**:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write  # Only if PR comments enabled
  checks: write         # For test results
```

**Pinned Action Versions**:
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: actions/setup-python@v5
- uses: actions/cache@v4
```

**No Secrets in Logs**:
- Never echo sensitive variables
- Use GitHub Secrets for API keys
- Mask sensitive output with ::add-mask::

### 2. Setup Instructions

**Repository Settings (via GitHub UI)**:
1. Branch protection rules for `main`:
   - Require PR reviews (1-2 reviewers)
   - Require status checks: lint, test (all matrix jobs), security, build
   - Require branches to be up to date
   - Dismiss stale reviews
   - Include administrators

2. GitHub Secrets (if needed):
   - `PYPI_API_TOKEN` (for releases)
   - Other service tokens

3. Enable features:
   - Dependabot alerts
   - Secret scanning
   - Code scanning (if applicable)

**Local Development Setup**:
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run checks locally (matches CI)
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Open coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

**Testing the Workflow**:
```bash
# (Optional) Test locally with act
act -j lint        # Test lint job
act -j test        # Test test job (may not work perfectly)

# Push to branch and verify
git checkout -b test-ci-setup
git push -u origin test-ci-setup
# Open PR and watch workflows run
```

### 3. Expected Results

After setup:
- ‚úÖ All PRs blocked until lint, test, security, build pass
- ‚úÖ 100% code coverage enforced automatically
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits
- ‚úÖ Dependencies auto-updated weekly
- ‚úÖ Fast CI feedback (1-2 min with cache)
- ‚úÖ PR comments with coverage and test results
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages for quick debugging

---

## TOOL COMPATIBILITY

**Black + Ruff + isort Harmony**:
- Use identical line-length (100) across all tools
- Set isort profile to "black" for compatibility
- Ruff should not contradict Black formatting

**Coverage Exclusions**:
- Exclude test files themselves
- Exclude __pycache__, .venv, build artifacts
- Allow pragma: no cover for defensive code
- Exclude __repr__, __main__, NotImplementedError

**Matrix Strategy**:
- Test on minimum supported version (3.11)
- Test on latest stable version (3.12)
- Skip redundant versions unless compatibility critical

---

## QUALITY STANDARDS

Generate workflows that:
- ‚úÖ Are valid YAML (no syntax errors)
- ‚úÖ Use current action versions (v4, v5)
- ‚úÖ Include inline comments explaining complex sections
- ‚úÖ Follow GitHub Actions best practices
- ‚úÖ Enable parallel execution for speed
- ‚úÖ Provide clear failure messages
- ‚úÖ Cache dependencies intelligently
- ‚úÖ Use minimal required permissions
- ‚úÖ Are production-ready (no placeholders)

---

## CONSTRAINTS

**DO**:
- Generate complete, copy-paste-ready files
- Include inline explanatory comments
- Optimize for fast CI execution (parallel jobs, caching)
- Match tool configurations (Black, Ruff, isort must agree)
- Provide practical, working defaults
- Pin action versions for security
- Use fail-fast for quick feedback

**DO NOT**:
- Use deprecated GitHub Actions syntax
- Hardcode secrets or tokens in workflows
- Create overly complex workflows
- Implement features not explicitly requested
- Skip security scanning steps
- Leave placeholder values (make working defaults)
- Use outdated action versions
```

**Performance**: Complete CI/CD setup generation in 3-5 minutes, immediately usable.

---

## Model-Specific Optimizations

### For Claude Opus / Sonnet 4 (Recommended)

Claude excels at this task due to:
- Excellent YAML syntax accuracy
- Strong understanding of CI/CD best practices
- Natural handling of structured, multi-file output
- Consistent inline documentation style

**Optimization**: Use XML-structured input for complex requirements:

```xml
<project_context>
  <repository_structure>
    - src/mypackage/ (main code)
    - tests/ (pytest tests)
    - docs/ (Sphinx documentation)
  </repository_structure>

  <testing_requirements>
    - Unit tests: 100% coverage
    - Integration tests: require PostgreSQL service container
    - Total coverage target: 95%
  </testing_requirements>

  <optional_features>
    - Enable PR automation
    - Enable first-contributor welcome
    - Skip release automation
  </optional_features>
</project_context>
```

**Result**: More accurate workflow generation with fewer iterations.

---

### For GPT-4

GPT-4 works well but may need additional guidance:

**Add explicit YAML validation reminder**:
```
IMPORTANT: Ensure all YAML syntax is correct. Double-check:
- Indentation (2 spaces, consistent)
- Matrix syntax for Python versions
- Cache key expressions (must use ${{ }} syntax)
- Conditional expressions (if:, needs:)
- String quoting in run: commands
```

**Simplify structure for first pass**:
- Request core CI workflow first
- Then request additional files separately
- Combine at the end

**Example incremental prompts**:
1. "Generate the main CI workflow only"
2. "Now generate the pre-commit config matching the CI"
3. "Finally, generate the pyproject.toml tool sections"

---

## Production Patterns

### Pattern 1: Standard Python Library (Single Package)

**Context**: Python library with src-layout, comprehensive tests, publish to PyPI

**Customization**:
```
Repository Structure:
- src/mylib/ (package code)
- tests/ (pytest tests, 100% coverage)
- docs/ (optional)
- pyproject.toml (build system, dependencies, tool configs)

Quality Requirements:
- Black (line length 100)
- Ruff (comprehensive rules)
- pytest with 100% coverage
- Security: Bandit, Safety

Optional Features:
- PR automation (coverage comments)
- Release automation to PyPI
- Status badges
```

**Expected Output**:
- Main CI workflow (~120 lines)
- Release workflow (~60 lines)
- Pre-commit config (~40 lines)
- pyproject.toml tool sections (~50 lines)
- PR template, Dependabot config

**Timeline**: CI runs in 1-2 minutes with caching

**Example Project**: Standard library like `requests`, `click`, `pydantic`

---

### Pattern 2: Application with Service Dependencies

**Context**: Python application requiring database, Redis, or other services for integration tests

**Customization**:
```
Repository Structure:
- src/myapp/ (application code)
- tests/unit/ (fast unit tests, 100% coverage)
- tests/integration/ (require PostgreSQL, 95% total coverage)
- docker-compose.yml (local development)

Testing Requirements:
- Unit tests: No dependencies, 100% coverage
- Integration tests: PostgreSQL 15 service container
- Combined coverage: 95%

Services:
- PostgreSQL 15
- Redis 7 (optional)
```

**Expected Output**:
- CI workflow with service containers (~180 lines)
- Separated unit and integration test jobs
- Service health checks and proper startup
- Conditional coverage calculation

**Example service configuration**:
```yaml
test-integration:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  services:
    postgres:
      image: postgres:15
      env:
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      options: >-
        --health-cmd pg_isready
        --health-interval 10s
        --health-timeout 5s
        --health-retries 5
      ports:
        - 5432:5432
```

**Timeline**: Unit tests 30s, integration tests 60-90s (with service startup)

**Example Project**: Django/Flask application, FastAPI with database

---

### Pattern 3: Monorepo with Multiple Packages

**Context**: Multiple related Python packages in single repository

**Customization**:
```
Repository Structure:
- packages/package-a/ (with own src/, tests/)
- packages/package-b/ (with own src/, tests/)
- packages/shared/ (common utilities)
- Shared tooling at root (pyproject.toml, .pre-commit-config.yaml)

Testing Strategy:
- Test each package separately
- Aggregate coverage across packages
- Path filtering (only test changed packages)

Matrix:
- Package x Python version (2D matrix)
```

**Expected Output**:
- CI workflow with package matrix (~150 lines)
- Path filtering to detect changed packages
- Aggregated coverage reporting
- Conditional job execution

**Example matrix strategy**:
```yaml
test:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      package: [package-a, package-b, shared]
      python-version: ['3.11', '3.12']
  steps:
    - name: Test ${{ matrix.package }}
      working-directory: packages/${{ matrix.package }}
      run: pytest --cov=src --cov-report=xml
```

**Timeline**: Parallel package testing, 2-3 minutes total

**Example Project**: Internal tooling suite, microservices monorepo

---

### Pattern 4: Open Source with Community Features

**Context**: Public repository accepting external contributions

**Customization**:
```
Repository Type: Open Source (public)

Optional Features:
- First-time contributor welcome message
- Auto-labeling (dependencies, docs, tests, bug, feature)
- Semantic versioning from conventional commits
- Automated changelog generation
- Release automation to PyPI
- Integration with Read the Docs
- CLA bot (if needed)

Community:
- CODEOWNERS for auto-review assignment
- PR template with comprehensive checklist
- Contribution guidelines link
```

**Expected Output**:
- Main CI workflow (~150 lines)
- Release workflow with changelog (~100 lines)
- First-contributor welcome workflow (~30 lines)
- PR labeler configuration
- Enhanced PR template

**Example labeler config** (`.github/labeler.yml`):
```yaml
dependencies:
  - pyproject.toml
  - requirements*.txt

docs:
  - docs/**/*
  - '**/*.md'

tests:
  - tests/**/*
```

**Timeline**: Same CI speed, plus community automation overhead

**Example Project**: Popular OSS like `httpx`, `typer`, `rich`

---

### Pattern 5: Enterprise / High-Security Requirements

**Context**: Projects with strict security, compliance, or audit requirements (HIPAA, SOC2, FINRA)

**Customization**:
```
Security Requirements:
- SAST: Bandit, Semgrep with OWASP ruleset
- SCA: Safety, pip-audit (strict mode)
- Secret scanning: TruffleHog, detect-secrets
- License compliance checking
- SBOM generation (CycloneDX, SPDX)
- Signed commits required

Compliance:
- Audit logs for all deployments
- Two-reviewer approval required
- No admin bypass on branch protection
- Automated security report generation
- Vulnerability disclosure workflow
```

**Expected Output**:
- Enhanced security workflow (~200 lines)
- Compliance reporting job
- SBOM generation on release
- Security report artifacts
- Stricter branch protection guidance

**Example Semgrep configuration**:
```yaml
security:
  steps:
    - name: Semgrep SAST
      run: |
        semgrep --config=p/owasp-top-ten \
                 --config=p/python \
                 --config=p/security-audit \
                 --error \
                 --json > semgrep-results.json

    - name: Upload Security Results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: security-scan-results
        path: |
          semgrep-results.json
          bandit-report.json
          safety-report.json
```

**Timeline**: Security scans add 1-2 minutes, total 3-4 minutes

**Example Project**: Healthcare platform, financial services, government

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Validation

Before committing the generated workflows:

**1. YAML Syntax Validation**
```bash
# Install yamllint
pip install yamllint

# Check all workflows
yamllint .github/workflows/

# Should return no errors
```

**2. Tool Compatibility Check**
```bash
# Verify Black and Ruff don't conflict
black --line-length 100 src/ --check
ruff check src/

# Should show same issues (if any)

# Verify isort compatibility
isort --profile black --check-only src/
```

**3. Pre-commit Matches CI**
```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run all hooks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Should produce identical results to what CI will show
```

**4. Local Coverage Test**
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term --cov-report=html

# Should hit 100% (or configured threshold)
# Open htmlcov/index.html to review
```

**5. Action Version Check**
```bash
# Verify actions are using current versions
grep "uses:" .github/workflows/*.yml

# Look for:
# - actions/checkout@v4 (not v3)
# - actions/setup-python@v5 (not v4)
# - actions/cache@v4
```

---

### Post-Deployment Validation

After setting up CI in your repository:

**1. First PR Test**
```bash
# Create test branch
git checkout -b test-ci-setup

# Make trivial change
echo "# Test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: Verify CI workflow"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin test-ci-setup
gh pr create --title "Test CI Setup" --body "Validating workflows"

# Watch workflows run
gh pr checks

# Verify:
# - All jobs run and pass
# - Run time < 5 minutes (preferably < 3)
# - PR comment with coverage appears (if enabled)
# - No errors in logs
```

**2. Branch Protection Verification**
```bash
# Check branch protection via GitHub CLI
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection

# Verify required checks:
# - lint
# - test (all matrix combinations)
# - security
# - build
```

**3. Cache Performance Check**

After 2-3 PR runs:
```bash
# Check cache hit rate
# GitHub ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Caches

# Should see:
# - pip cache entries
# - Cache hit rate > 80% after first run
# - Size: 50-200MB typical for Python projects
```

**4. Security Scan Validation**

Test that security tools catch issues:
```python
# Add to a test file temporarily
def vulnerable_code(user_input):
    eval(user_input)  # Bandit should flag this
```

```bash
# Push and verify
git add . && git commit -m "test: Security scan test"
git push

# CI should FAIL with clear Bandit error
# Remove after verification
```

**5. Coverage Enforcement Test**

Add untested code:
```python
# Add to your package
def untested_function():
    return "This will break coverage"
```

```bash
# Push without test
git add . && git commit -m "test: Coverage enforcement"
git push

# CI should FAIL with coverage < 100% message
# Verify error message is clear
```

---

### Edge Cases to Test

| Test Case | Expected Behavior | Validation |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Documentation-only change** | Skip most jobs (if path filtering enabled) | Update README.md only, push, check which jobs ran |
| **Dependency update** | Cache miss, rebuild dependencies | Modify pyproject.toml, verify cache refreshes |
| **Failed test** | Fast failure with clear error | Add failing test, confirm CI stops quickly |
| **Format violation** | Black check fails with diff | Add poorly formatted code, verify error message |
| **Security issue** | Bandit/Semgrep flags with severity | Add `MD5` hash usage, confirm detection |
| **Import error** | Build job catches broken imports | Add `import nonexistent_module`, verify failure |
| **Concurrent PRs** | Old runs cancelled (concurrency control) | Push twice rapidly, verify first run cancelled |

---

### Common Failure Modes and Fixes

| Issue | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Black vs Ruff conflict** | Ruff wants change, Black rejects | Conflicting formatting rules | Add Ruff rule to `ignore = [...]` in pyproject.toml |
| **Coverage calculation wrong** | Shows <100% but all code tested | Incorrect `omit` patterns | Check `[tool.coverage.run]` omit includes tests/, __pycache__ |
| **Cache never hits** | Slow CI every time | Wrong cache key | Use `hashFiles('**/pyproject.toml')` in key |
| **Service container not ready** | Integration tests fail randomly | Missing health check | Add `options: --health-cmd` to service config |
| **Pre-commit skips files** | CI finds issues pre-commit missed | Different file exclusions | Ensure pre-commit doesn't have extra `exclude:` |
| **Workflow doesn't trigger** | Push doesn't start CI | Branch name mismatch | Check `on.push.branches` includes your branch |
| **Coverage comment missing** | No PR comment appears | Missing permissions | Add `pull-requests: write` to permissions |
| **Matrix job not running** | Only one Python version tested | Matrix syntax error | Verify `strategy.matrix.python-version` is list |
| **Dependabot PRs fail** | Auto-updates don't pass CI | Outdated test assumptions | Review and update tests for new dependency versions |
| **Action version outdated** | Deprecation warnings | Using old action versions | Update to v4/v5 (checkout, setup-python, cache) |

---

### Performance Benchmarks

Expected CI execution times for typical Python project:

| Stage | First Run (No Cache) | Subsequent Runs (Cached) | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Checkout | 3-5s | 3-5s | Consistent |
| Setup Python | 5-10s | 2-5s | Cached installations |
| Install dependencies | 60-90s | 10-20s | Biggest cache benefit |
| Lint (Black, Ruff, isort) | 5-10s | 3-5s | Fast |
| Unit tests | 10-30s | 10-30s | No cache benefit |
| Security scans | 30-60s | 20-40s | Some tools cache |
| Build verification | 10-20s | 8-15s | Minimal cache benefit |
| **Total (parallel)** | **2-4 minutes** | **1-2 minutes** | Jobs run concurrently |

**If CI takes >5 minutes with caching**:
1. Profile tests: `pytest --durations=10` (find slowest tests)
2. Check for network calls (should be mocked)
3. Review matrix (do you need all Python versions every time?)
4. Consider splitting integration tests to separate workflow

**Optimization priority**:
1. ‚úÖ Dependency caching (biggest impact)
2. ‚úÖ Parallel job execution
3. ‚úÖ Path filtering (skip unnecessary runs)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Concurrency control (cancel outdated runs)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Matrix reduction (balance coverage vs speed)

## Compliance and Security Considerations

### For HIPAA/FINRA/SOC2 Compliance

**Additional requirements**:

1. **Audit Logging**
   - Enable GitHub Advanced Security audit log streaming
   - Retain CI/CD logs for required period (typically 1-7 years)
   - Track all approvals and deployments

2. **Access Control**
   - Signed commits required (GPG)
   - 2+ reviewer approval for production changes
   - No admin bypass on branch protection
   - MFA enforced for all contributors

3. **Security Scanning Enhancement**
   ```yaml
   compliance-check:
     steps:
       - Verify all commits signed
       - Generate SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
       - License compatibility check
       - Secret scanning with push protection
       - Data classification validation
   ```

4. **Deployment Attestation**
   ```yaml
   - name: Generate Provenance
     uses: actions/attest-build-provenance@v1
     with:
       subject-path: 'dist/*'
   ```

---

### Data Handling in CI

**Never log sensitive data**:
```yaml
# BAD
- run: echo "API_KEY=${{ secrets.API_KEY }}"

# GOOD
- run: |
    echo "::add-mask::${{ secrets.API_KEY }}"
    # Use secret without logging
```

**Mask variables**:
```yaml
- name: Mask Sensitive Output
  run: echo "::add-mask::$SENSITIVE_VALUE"
```

**Limit log retention**:
```yaml
# Organization setting (not in workflow)
# Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Artifact and log retention
# Set to minimum required (e.g., 30 days for compliance)
```

---

## Integration with Other Services

### Codecov

```yaml
- name: Upload Coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./coverage.xml
    fail_ci_if_error: true
    flags: unittests
```

### Read the Docs

```yaml
- name: Trigger RTD Build
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: |
    curl -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Token ${{ secrets.RTD_TOKEN }}" \
      https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/projects/YOUR_PROJECT/versions/latest/builds/
```

### Slack Notifications

```yaml
- name: Notify Slack on Failure
  if: failure() && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1
  with:
    webhook-url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
    payload: |
      {
        "text": "CI failed on main: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}"
      }
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I really use 100% coverage requirement?**

A: Context-dependent:
- **Libraries & critical paths**: Yes, 100% is achievable and valuable
- **Applications with integration layers**: 90-95% more practical
- **Prototypes/experiments**: 80% is often sufficient

Adjust `fail_under` in `[tool.coverage.report]` as appropriate.

---

**Q: How can I test workflows before pushing?**

A: Use [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act):
```bash
# Install act
brew install act  # macOS
# or download from GitHub

# Test specific job
act -j lint

# Test entire workflow
act pull_request

# Note: Service containers and matrix may not work perfectly
```

---

**Q: My CI is slow. How to optimize?**

A: Optimization priority:
1. **Verify caching** - Should see >80% hit rate after first run
2. **Profile tests** - `pytest --durations=10` finds slowest
3. **Path filtering** - Skip CI for docs-only changes
4. **Matrix reduction** - Do you need all Python versions every time?
5. **Parallel execution** - Ensure jobs aren't serialized unnecessarily

---

**Q: Should I pin action versions with SHA or tags?**

A: Hybrid approach recommended:
- **Trusted actions** (`actions/*`): Use tags (`@v4`) for maintainability
- **Third-party**: Use SHA (`@abc123...`) for security
- **Update quarterly**: Review for security patches and new features

---

**Q: How do I handle secrets in tests?**

A: Prefer mocking:
```python
# Instead of real API calls
def test_api_call(mocker):
    mocker.patch('requests.get', return_value=mock_response)
    # Test logic without real API
```

If real credentials needed:
- Use GitHub Secrets
- Separate workflow with environment protection
- Never commit `.env` files
