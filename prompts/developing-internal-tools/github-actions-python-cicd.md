## Workflow Organization

Create separate workflow files for:
1. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Main CI pipeline (lint, test, security)
2. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - Release automation (optional)
3. **`.github/dependabot.yml`** - Dependency update configuration

## CI Pipeline Structure

The main CI workflow must:
- Run on: push to main, all pull requests, manual dispatch
- Use parallel jobs for optimal performance (lint, test, security run concurrently)
- Implement fail-fast: any check failure fails the entire pipeline
- Cache dependencies intelligently (pip cache, pre-commit cache)
- Use path filtering to skip when only docs change
- Generate PR comments with results summary

### Job: Lint and Format
```yaml
- Black formatting check (--check --diff)
- Ruff linting with comprehensive rules
- isort import ordering validation
```

### Job: Test
```yaml
- Matrix: Python 3.11 and 3.12
- Install dependencies with cache
- Run pytest with coverage
- Generate coverage report
- Upload coverage artifact
- Fail if coverage < 100%
```

### Job: Security
```yaml
- Bandit security scan
- Safety vulnerability check
- Semgrep SAST analysis
- pip-audit supply chain check
```

### Job: Build
```yaml
- Verify package builds (wheel + sdist)
- Validate pyproject.toml
- Check imports
```

## Configuration Files

### `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
Match CI configuration exactly:
- black (same line length)
- ruff (same rules)
- isort (same profile)
- trailing whitespace, end-of-file fixer
- check-yaml, check-toml

### `pyproject.toml` Tool Configuration
Provide complete configuration sections for:

**[tool.black]**
- line-length = 100
- target-version = ['py311', 'py312']

**[tool.ruff]**
- Comprehensive select rules: I, F, E, W, C90, N, UP, S, B, A, C4, DTZ, DJ, EM, PIE, PT, Q, RET, SIM, TID, TCH, ARG, PGH, PLE, PLR, PLW, RUF
- line-length = 100
- Ignore specific rules if needed (document why)

**[tool.isort]**
- profile = "black"
- line_length = 100

**[tool.coverage.run]**
- omit = ["tests/*", "**/__pycache__/*", ".venv/*", "setup.py"]

**[tool.coverage.report]**
- fail_under = 100
- show_missing = true

### `.github/dependabot.yml`
- Package ecosystem: pip
- Schedule: weekly
- Open PR limit: 5
- Reviewers: (if specified)

### `.github/pull_request_template.md`
Include checklist:
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Changelog entry added
- [ ] All CI checks passing
- [ ] Coverage at 100%

### `.github/CODEOWNERS` (if applicable)
Define code ownership for auto-review assignment

## Developer Experience Features

### PR Comments
When tests complete, post comment with:
- ✅/❌ Status summary
- Coverage report with diff vs base branch
- Security scan results
- Link to full logs

### Status Badges
Generate markdown for README badges:
- Build status
- Coverage percentage
- Security scan status
- Python versions tested

### First-Time Contributor Welcome
On first PR from new contributor:
- Welcome message
- Link to CONTRIBUTING.md
- Guide to running tests locally

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache pip dependencies (key: hashFiles('**/pyproject.toml'))
   - Cache pre-commit environments
   - Cache build artifacts between jobs

2. **Concurrency Controls**
   ```yaml
   concurrency:
     group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
     cancel-in-progress: true
   ```

3. **Path Filtering**
   Skip CI for documentation-only changes:
   ```yaml
   paths-ignore:
     - '**.md'
     - 'docs/**'
   ```

## Security Best Practices

- Use `permissions:` to grant minimal GITHUB_TOKEN access
- Pin action versions with SHA hashes (not tags)
- Use GitHub Secrets for any API keys
- Never log sensitive information
- Implement branch protection rules

## Output Format

For each file, provide:
1. **File path** (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
2. **Complete file content** with inline comments explaining key sections
3. **Configuration rationale** - why these settings

For pyproject.toml, only provide the `[tool.*]` sections to be added (don't rewrite entire file).

Include a **Setup Instructions** section with:
1. Required GitHub repository settings (branch protection)
2. GitHub Secrets to configure (if any)
3. Local development setup commands
4. How to test workflows locally (act, if applicable)

## Validation Checklist

Before considering the setup complete, verify:
- [ ] All workflow YAML is valid (yamllint)
- [ ] Pre-commit config matches CI exactly
- [ ] Tool configurations are compatible (black + ruff + isort)
- [ ] Coverage exclusions are appropriate
- [ ] Caching keys are correct
- [ ] Branch protection enforces all required checks
- [ ] First PR will test all gates successfully
</implementation_requirements>

## 📈 Expected Results

After setup:
- ✅ All PRs must pass linting, tests, security scans
- ✅ 100% code coverage enforced automatically
- ✅ Dependencies updated weekly via Dependabot
- ✅ Fast feedback (typically < 3 minutes for CI)
- ✅ Clear PR comments with test results and coverage

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue: Coverage failing at 99%**
- Check excluded paths in pyproject.toml
- Ensure all code paths have tests
- Review coverage report for missed lines

**Issue: Ruff and Black conflicts**
- Verify line-length matches (100 in both)
- Check ruff ignores any Black-related rules

**Issue: CI slow**
- Review cache hit rates
- Consider reducing matrix (fewer Python versions)
- Check if unnecessary files trigger CI
</output_structure>
```

## Model-Specific Optimizations

### For Claude Opus 4 / Sonnet 4 (Recommended)

Claude excels at this task due to:
- Strong YAML generation accuracy
- Deep understanding of CI/CD best practices
- Excellent inline documentation
- Consistent formatting across all files

**Optimization**: Use XML tags for complex nested configuration. Claude handles structured input/output naturally.

```xml
<project_context>
  <repository_structure>
    <!-- Describe your actual structure -->
  </repository_structure>

  <custom_requirements>
    <!-- Add project-specific needs -->
    - Integration tests that require Docker
    - API tests with external service mocking
    - Performance benchmarks
  </custom_requirements>
</project_context>
```

### For GPT-4

GPT-4 performs well but may need additional constraints:

**Add this section:**
```
IMPORTANT: Ensure all YAML syntax is correct. Double-check:
- Indentation (2 spaces)
- Matrix syntax for Python versions
- Cache key expressions
- Conditional expressions (${{ }})
```

### For Claude Sonnet 3.5

Works well for most projects. If output is truncated:
- Request files individually: "Generate just the CI workflow first"
- Then iterate: "Now generate the pyproject.toml configuration"
- Combine at the end

---

## Production Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Package Repository

**Context**: Python package with src layout, tests, standard tooling

**Customization**:
```xml
<repository_structure>
- Single package in src/mypackage/
- Tests in tests/
- pyproject.toml with build-system
- No Docker, no external services
</repository_structure>

<quality_requirements>
- 100% coverage (strict)
- Black + Ruff + isort
- Security scans (Bandit, Safety)
- Test on Python 3.11, 3.12
</quality_requirements>
```

**Expected output**: Core CI workflow, pre-commit, tool configs. ~300 lines total.

---

### Pattern 2: Application with External Dependencies

**Context**: CLI tool or application requiring database, Redis, etc.

**Customization**:
```xml
<repository_structure>
- Application code in src/
- Integration tests require PostgreSQL
- API tests require Redis
- Docker Compose for local dev
</repository_structure>

<testing>
- Unit tests (no dependencies)
- Integration tests (use GitHub Service containers)
- Coverage: 95% (relaxed for integration layers)
</testing>

<services>
- PostgreSQL 15
- Redis 7
</services>
```

**Expected output**: CI workflow with service containers, separated unit/integration test jobs, Docker layer caching.

**Example service configuration**:
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    env:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    options: >-
      --health-cmd pg_isready
      --health-interval 10s
```

---

### Pattern 3: Monorepo with Multiple Packages

**Context**: Multiple related Python packages in one repository

**Customization**:
```xml
<repository_structure>
- packages/package-a/
- packages/package-b/
- Shared tooling configuration at root
- Each package has own tests/
</repository_structure>

<testing>
- Run tests for each package separately
- Aggregate coverage across packages
- Matrix: package x Python version
</testing>

<path_filtering>
- Only test affected packages (detect changes)
</path_filtering>
```

**Expected output**: Matrix strategy for packages, path filtering to run only affected tests, aggregated coverage reporting.

**Example matrix**:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    package: [package-a, package-b]
    python-version: ['3.11', '3.12']
```

---

### Pattern 4: Open Source with Community Features

**Context**: Public repository, accepting external contributions

**Customization**:
```xml
<optional_features>
- First-time contributor welcome bot
- Automated changelog generation
- Semantic versioning from conventional commits
- Auto-label PRs (dependencies, docs, tests)
- Release automation to PyPI
- Integration with Read the Docs
</optional_features>

<community>
- Auto-assign reviewers from CODEOWNERS
- Require issue linking in PRs
- CLA bot for contributor agreements (if needed)
</community>
```

**Expected output**: Extended CI with PR labeling, contributor welcome workflow, release automation workflow, comprehensive PR template.

---

### Pattern 5: High-Security / Compliance Requirements

**Context**: Projects with strict security/compliance needs (healthcare, finance)

**Customization**:
```xml
<security>
- SAST: Bandit, Semgrep with OWASP rules
- SCA: Safety, pip-audit with strict mode
- Secret scanning: TruffleHog
- License compliance checking
- SBOM generation
- Signed commits required
</security>

<compliance>
- Audit logs for all deployments
- Require two-reviewer approval
- No direct pushes to main (even admins)
- Automated security report generation
</compliance>
```

**Expected output**: Enhanced security workflow with additional scanners, compliance reporting, stricter branch protection guidance.

**Example Semgrep config**:
```yaml
- name: Semgrep Security Scan
  run: |
    semgrep --config=p/owasp-top-ten \
             --config=p/python \
             --error \
             --json > semgrep-results.json
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Python Library

**Input**:
```xml
<repository_structure>
- src/mylib/ (package code)
- tests/ (pytest tests)
- pyproject.toml (Poetry)
</repository_structure>

<python_versions>
Python 3.11 and 3.12
</python_versions>

<quality_requirements>
Standard: Black (line 100), Ruff, 100% coverage
</quality_requirements>
```

**Output**: Complete CI workflow (120 lines), pre-commit config (40 lines), pyproject.toml tool sections (60 lines), PR template, Dependabot config.

**Timeline**: All quality gates run in ~2-3 minutes with caching.

---

### Example 2: CLI Application with Database

**Input**:
```xml
<repository_structure>
- src/mycli/ (Click-based CLI)
- tests/unit/ (fast unit tests)
- tests/integration/ (require PostgreSQL)
- Docker Compose for local dev
</repository_structure>

<testing>
- Unit tests: 100% coverage
- Integration tests: use GitHub service containers
- Total coverage: 95%
</testing>

<services>
- PostgreSQL 15
</services>
```

**Output**:
- CI workflow with separated unit/integration jobs (~180 lines)
- Service container configuration for PostgreSQL
- Conditional coverage calculation (unit=100%, total=95%)
- Docker layer caching for faster integration tests

**Example job separation**:
```yaml
unit-tests:
  # No services, fast execution

integration-tests:
  needs: unit-tests
  services:
    postgres: ...
  # Run after unit tests pass
```

---

### Example 3: Open Source with Release Automation

**Input**:
```xml
<repository_structure>
- Standard Python package
- Publish to PyPI on release
</repository_structure>

<optional_features>
- Semantic versioning from conventional commits
- Automated changelog generation
- Release to PyPI on GitHub release
- First-time contributor welcome
</optional_features>

<release>
- Build wheel and sdist
- Publish to PyPI using API token
- Create GitHub release with changelog
</release>
```

**Output**:
- Main CI workflow (~150 lines)
- Release workflow triggered on tag push (~80 lines)
- Automated version bumping based on commit messages
- Changelog generation from PR titles
- PyPI publish with trusted publisher (OIDC)

**Release workflow trigger**:
```yaml
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
```

---

## Testing and Validation Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Validation

Before committing the generated workflows:

- [ ] **YAML Syntax**: Run `yamllint .github/workflows/` (install: `pip install yamllint`)
- [ ] **Tool Compatibility**: Verify Black and Ruff don't conflict
  - Check: `black --line-length 100 src/` shouldn't reformat what Ruff accepts
- [ ] **Pre-commit Matches CI**:
  - Run `pre-commit run --all-files`
  - Should produce same results as CI will
- [ ] **Coverage Config**: Test locally `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term`
  - Should match 100% (or configured threshold)
- [ ] **Action Versions**: All actions use SHA pinning or recent versions
  - Example: `actions/checkout@v4` or `actions/checkout@abc123...`

### Post-Deployment Validation

After setting up CI:

- [ ] **First PR Test**: Create a small PR (e.g., update README)
  - Verify all workflow jobs run
  - Check run time (should be <5 minutes with cache)
  - Confirm PR comment appears with results
- [ ] **Branch Protection**: Verify settings in GitHub
  - Required checks enabled
  - Dismiss stale reviews enabled
  - Admins included in restrictions
- [ ] **Cache Performance**: Check cache hit rates after 2-3 PR runs
  - Should see >80% cache hit rate
  - Actions tab → Caches shows entries
- [ ] **Security Scans**: Introduce a test vulnerability
  - Example: `eval(user_input)` in test file
  - Bandit should catch and fail CI
- [ ] **Coverage Enforcement**: Add untested code
  - Coverage should drop below 100%
  - CI should fail with clear message

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **Documentation-only change**: Update README.md
   - Should skip most CI jobs (if path filtering configured)

2. **Dependency update**: Modify pyproject.toml dependencies
   - Cache should miss, rebuild dependencies
   - All tests should still pass

3. **Failed test**: Introduce a failing test
   - CI fails fast with clear error
   - Coverage report shows failure location

4. **Format violation**: Add poorly formatted code
   - Black check fails
   - Error message shows exact issue
   - Running `black .` locally fixes it

5. **Security issue**: Add `MD5` hash usage
   - Bandit flags as security issue
   - Semgrep may also flag
   - Clear remediation guidance

### Common Failure Modes and Fixes

| Issue | Symptom | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Black vs Ruff conflict** | Ruff wants change, Black wants different change | Add conflicting rules to ruff `ignore = [...]` |
| **Coverage calculation wrong** | Shows <100% but all code covered | Check `omit` patterns in `[tool.coverage.run]` |
| **Cache never hits** | Slow CI every time | Verify cache key uses `hashFiles('**/pyproject.toml')` |
| **Service container not ready** | Integration tests fail randomly | Add health check options to service config |
| **Pre-commit skips files** | CI finds issues pre-commit missed | Ensure pre-commit doesn't exclude same paths |
| **Workflow doesn't trigger** | Push doesn't start CI | Check branch name in `on.push.branches` |
| **Coverage report not posted** | No PR comment appears | Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `pull-requests: write` permission |

### Performance Benchmarks

Expected CI performance (typical Python package):

| Stage | Time (First Run) | Time (Cached) |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Dependency install | 60-90s | 10-15s |
| Linting (Black, Ruff, isort) | 5-10s | 3-5s |
| Unit tests | 10-30s | 10-30s |
| Security scans | 30-60s | 20-40s |
| Build verification | 10-20s | 8-15s |
| **Total** | **2-4 min** | **1-2 min** |

If CI takes >5 minutes with caching:
1. Profile test suite: `pytest --durations=10`
2. Check for network calls in tests (should be mocked)
3. Review matrix size (do you need all Python versions every time?)
4. Consider splitting slow integration tests to separate workflow

---

## Advanced Customizations

### Add Performance Benchmarking

Compare performance against base branch:

```yaml
- name: Benchmark Performance
  run: |
    pytest tests/benchmarks/ --benchmark-json=output.json
    python scripts/compare_benchmarks.py \
      --current=output.json \
      --baseline=main
```

### Add Security Report Summary

Generate weekly security reports:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-report.yml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Monday 9 AM

jobs:
  security-summary:
    steps:
      - Run all security scans
      - Aggregate results
      - Post to Slack/email
```

### Add Automated Dependency Updates with Auto-merge

Safe auto-merge for minor/patch updates:

```yaml
# After Dependabot creates PR
if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'
  # Run full CI
  # If tests pass AND is minor/patch
  # Auto-merge
```

### Add Release Notes Generation

Automatically generate release notes from PRs:

```yaml
- uses: release-drafter/release-drafter@v5
  with:
    config-name: release-drafter.yml
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

---

## Compliance and Security Considerations

### HIPAA/FINRA/SOC2 Compliance

If handling sensitive data:

1. **Audit Logging**: Enable GitHub audit log streaming
2. **Branch Protection**: Require signed commits, 2+ reviewers
3. **Secret Scanning**: Enable GitHub secret scanning + push protection
4. **Dependency Verification**: Use lock files, verify checksums
5. **SBOM**: Generate Software Bill of Materials on release

**Additional workflow job**:
```yaml
compliance-check:
  - Verify all commits signed
  - Generate SBOM
  - Check license compatibility
  - Validate no secrets in code
```

### Data Handling

- **Never log sensitive data** in CI output
- **Use GitHub Secrets** for all credentials
- **Mask variables** containing sensitive info
- **Limit log retention** to minimum required (default 90 days)

## Integration with Other Tools

### Read the Docs
```yaml
# Trigger RTD build on successful main merge
- name: Trigger Docs Build
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: |
    curl -X POST -d "token=${{ secrets.RTD_WEBHOOK_TOKEN }}" \
      https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/projects/...
```

### Codecov
```yaml
- name: Upload Coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./coverage.xml
    fail_ci_if_error: true
```

### Slack Notifications
```yaml
- name: Notify Slack on Failure
  if: failure()
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1
  with:
    payload: |
      {
        "text": "CI failed on ${{ github.ref }}"
      }
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I use 100% coverage requirement?**
A: For libraries and critical paths, yes. For applications with integration layers, 90-95% is more practical. Adjust `fail_under` in coverage config.

**Q: How do I test workflows locally before pushing?**
A: Use [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act): `act -j lint` runs the lint job locally. Not all features work (services, matrix), but catches syntax errors.

**Q: My CI is slow. How to optimize?**
A:
1. Check cache hit rates (should be >80%)
2. Use matrix sparingly (do you need all Python versions every time?)
3. Path filtering for docs/tests changes
4. Split slow integration tests to separate workflow

**Q: Should I pin action versions with SHA or tags?**
A: SHA is more secure, tags are more maintainable. Compromise: use tags for trusted actions (actions/*), SHA for third-party.

**Q: How to handle secrets in tests?**
A: Use GitHub Secrets for real credentials, but prefer mocking external services. If real API needed, use separate workflow with environment protection.

**Q: Can I skip CI for work-in-progress PRs?**
A: Yes, add `[skip ci]` to commit message, or use draft PRs (configure workflow to skip drafts).
