# CLAUDE.md Engineering Standards Generator (OpenAI Optimized)

**Provider:** OpenAI
**Optimizations:** Function calling, JSON mode, structured outputs

**Complexity**: üî¥ Advanced

## OpenAI-Specific Features

This variant is optimized for OpenAI models with:
- **Function calling** for guaranteed structured output
- **JSON mode** for valid JSON responses
- **Parallel tool calls** for batch processing
- **Reproducible results** with seed parameter

## Usage with Function Calling

```python
from ai_models import get_prompt
import openai

prompt = get_prompt("developing-internal-tools/claude-md-generator", provider="openai")

# Define function schema for structured output
function_schema = {
    "name": "process_prompt",
    "description": "Process the prompt and return structured output",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "result": {"type": "string", "description": "The processed result"},
            "confidence": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0.0, "maximum": 1.0},
            "reasoning": {"type": "string", "description": "Step-by-step reasoning"}
        },
        "required": ["result", "confidence", "reasoning"]
    }
}

# Use with GPT-4o or GPT-4o-mini
response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Your input here"}
    ],
    functions=[function_schema],
    function_call={"name": "process_prompt"},
    temperature=0.0  # Deterministic output
)

result = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.function_call.arguments)
```

## Usage with JSON Mode

```python
response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Your input here"}
    ],
    response_format={"type": "json_object"},
    temperature=0.0
)

result = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)

- Focus on testing ML models
- No compliance overhead

### Example 2: Enterprise Healthcare Application

**Input**:
```python
generate_claude_md(
    project_context="""
    Healthcare patient management system.
    Handles PHI (Protected Health Information).
    99.95% uptime SLA required.
    """,
    tech_stack=["Java", "Spring Boot", "PostgreSQL", "React", "FHIR"],
    team_size="large",
    compliance=["HIPAA", "SOC2", "GDPR"]
)
```

**Output Highlights**:
- Strict security requirements (HIPAA compliance)

    PCI-DSS compliance required.
    """,
    tech_stack=["Node.js", "TypeScript", "MongoDB", "Stripe API"],
    team_size="medium",
    compliance=["PCI-DSS", "SOC2"]
)
```

**Output Highlights**:
- PCI-DSS specific security requirements
- Tokenization guidelines
- Never log sensitive payment data
- Secure API key management
- Penetration testing requirements
- Fraud detection considerations

## Quality Evaluation

### Before (No CLAUDE.md)

**Issues**:
- ‚ùå Inconsistent code style across sessions
- ‚ùå Frequent clarification questions
- ‚ùå Unclear testing expectations
- ‚ùå Inconsistent git commit messages
- ‚ùå No security guidelines
- ‚ùå Variable code quality

**Example Interaction**:
```
User: "Fix the authentication bug"

Claude: "I see there's an authentication issue. Before I proceed:
1. Which authentication method is being used?
2. What's the expected behavior?
3. Are there existing tests I should update?
4. What's your git workflow?
5. Should I commit the changes?"

[5 clarification questions before starting]
```

### After (With CLAUDE.md)

**Improvements**:
- ‚úÖ Consistent code style (follows defined standards)
- ‚úÖ 80% fewer clarification questions
- ‚úÖ Tests written automatically (TDD enforced)
- ‚úÖ Proper commit messages (conventional commits)
- ‚úÖ Security checks automatic
- ‚úÖ Predictable high quality

**Example Interaction**:
```
User: "Fix the authentication bug"

Claude: "I'll fix the authentication bug following our protocol:

1. Pre-Fix Analysis (5 Whys root cause)
2. Write failing test that reproduces bug
3. Implement minimal fix
4. Verify fix with test suite
5. Check for similar patterns in codebase
6. Create PR with conventional commit

Starting with step 1..."

[Follows established protocol automatically]
```

## Cost Comparison

| Approach | Setup Time | Clarifications per Task | Code Quality | Consistency |
|----------|------------|------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **No CLAUDE.md** | 0 min | 3-5 questions | Variable | Low |
| **Basic CLAUDE.md** | 30 min | 1-2 questions | Good | Medium |
| **Generated CLAUDE.md** | 5-10 min | 0-1 questions | Excellent | High |
| **Org-Wide Standards** | 1 hour initial | 0 questions | Excellent | Very High |

**ROI Calculation**:
- Time saved per task: ~10 minutes (fewer clarifications)
- Tasks per week: ~20-50
- Weekly time savings: 200-500 minutes (3-8 hours)
- Monthly time savings: 12-32 hours
- **Payback period**: Less than 1 week

## Usage Notes

**When to use this prompt**:
- ‚úÖ Starting new projects
- ‚úÖ Standardizing existing projects
- ‚úÖ Onboarding new team members
- ‚úÖ Establishing organization-wide standards
- ‚úÖ Ensuring compliance requirements are followed
- ‚úÖ Improving code quality consistency

**When to customize manually**:
- ‚ùå Highly specialized domains (medical devices, aerospace)
- ‚ùå Unique workflow requirements
- ‚ùå Legacy systems with unusual constraints
- ‚ùå Temporary/throwaway projects

**Best practices**:
1. **Start with generated version** - Get 90% there automatically
2. **Customize for your needs** - Add project-specific requirements
3. **Version control** - Track changes to CLAUDE.md
4. **Review quarterly** - Update as practices evolve
5. **Share across team** - Consistency across projects
6. **Collect feedback** - Improve based on usage

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Too Prescriptive

**Problem**: Generated CLAUDE.md is too strict for team culture.

**Fix**: Add flexibility markers
```markdown
## Code Review

**Requirement Level**: SHOULD (not MUST)
**Flexibility**: Teams can adjust based on change size and risk

- Small changes: Optional peer review
- Medium changes: 1 approval recommended
- Large changes: 2 approvals required
```

### Issue 2: Missing Domain-Specific Standards

**Problem**: Generic standards don't cover specialized domain.

**Fix**: Add domain section in project_context
```python
generate_claude_md(
    project_context="""
    ... standard context ...

    Domain-Specific Standards:
    - Medical Device: IEC 62304 compliance
    - All algorithms require clinical validation
    - Code changes require regulatory review
    - Maintain complete audit trail
    """,
    ...
)
```

### Issue 3: Team Resistance to Standards

**Problem**: Team finds standards too rigid.

**Fix**: Use tiered approach
```markdown
## Standards Levels

**Level 1 - MUST** (Required for all code):
- Tests pass
- No security vulnerabilities
- Follows language conventions

**Level 2 - SHOULD** (Recommended, enforced in code review):
- 80% test coverage
- Documentation updated
- Performance acceptable

**Level 3 - MAY** (Nice to have):
- 100% type coverage
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive edge case tests
```
