# License FAQ

Common questions about licensing for PM-Prompt-Patterns.

## General Questions

### Why MIT License?

We chose the MIT License because it:
- ✅ **Maximizes sharing** - Anyone can use, modify, and distribute
- ✅ **Enables commercial use** - No restrictions on commercial projects
- ✅ **Minimizes friction** - Simple, well-understood, widely adopted
- ✅ **Builds community** - Encourages contributions and derivatives
- ✅ **Protects contributors** - Includes liability disclaimer

The MIT License is used by major projects like React, Node.js, and VS Code. It's the gold standard for developer tools and libraries.

### What exactly is covered by the MIT License?

**Everything in this repository**, including:
- Prompt patterns and templates
- Python code (`ai_models` system)
- YAML model definitions
- Documentation (markdown files)
- Examples and test suites
- Scripts and automation

All content is MIT licensed unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Commercial Use

### Can I use these prompts in a commercial product?

**Yes, absolutely.** The MIT License explicitly permits commercial use. You can:
- ✅ Use prompts in SaaS products
- ✅ Include in proprietary software
- ✅ Sell products built with these prompts
- ✅ Use in client consulting work
- ✅ Include in paid courses or training
- ✅ Incorporate into commercial prompt libraries

**No royalties, no fees, no restrictions.**

### Do I need to share my commercial product's code?

**No.** The MIT License does not require you to:
- ❌ Open source your product
- ❌ Share modifications publicly
- ❌ Disclose that you used these prompts
- ❌ Pay any fees or royalties

You can build closed-source commercial products freely.

### Do I need to credit PM-Prompt-Patterns in my product?

**Not required, but appreciated.** The MIT License only requires:
- ✅ Include the LICENSE text in your code distribution (if you distribute code)
- ✅ Include copyright notice in your code distribution

It does NOT require:
- ❌ Attribution in your product UI
- ❌ Mention in marketing materials
- ❌ Link back to the repository

**However**, attribution helps:
- Shows due diligence to stakeholders
- Builds trust with customers
- Helps others discover the resource
- Supports the open source community

**Suggested attribution** (optional):

## Generated Content

### Who owns content generated using these prompts?

**You do.** Content generated by running these prompts through an LLM belongs to you:
- ✅ LLM outputs are yours to use freely
- ✅ Analysis results belong to you
- ✅ Reports, summaries, and generated text are yours
- ✅ No claims on derivative works from outputs

**Example**: If you use our "feature prioritization" prompt with Claude to generate a prioritization report, that report is **yours**. You can use it commercially, share it, or keep it private.

### What about the LLM provider's terms?

You still need to comply with your LLM provider's terms:
- **Anthropic**: Check [Claude's Terms](https://console.anthropic.com/legal/terms)
- **OpenAI**: Check [OpenAI's Terms](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use)
- **Google**: Check [Gemini's Terms](https://ai.google.dev/terms)

Most providers grant you ownership of outputs, but review their specific terms.

## Modifications

### Can I modify the prompts?

**Yes, freely.** You can:
- ✅ Adapt prompts for your use case
- ✅ Combine multiple prompts
- ✅ Translate to other languages
- ✅ Optimize for different models
- ✅ Add your own examples
- ✅ Completely rewrite

Modified prompts are yours under the MIT License terms.

### Do I have to share my modifications?

**No.** You can:
- Keep modifications private
- Use in proprietary products
- Share publicly if you want
- License differently (subject to MIT terms)

**But we encourage sharing!** If your modifications improve quality, reduce cost, or solve new use cases, consider contributing back. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Can I sell modified versions?

**Yes.** You can:
- ✅ Sell modified prompt collections
- ✅ Include in paid products
- ✅ Offer as consulting deliverables
- ✅ Package in commercial tools

Just include the original MIT License and copyright notice in your distribution.

## Attribution & Credit

### When is attribution required?

**Only if you distribute code.** The MIT License requires:

**Required** (when distributing code):
- Include the LICENSE file
- Keep copyright notices

**Not required**:
- Attribution in UI or documentation
- Mention in marketing
- Link back to repository

### When is attribution appreciated?

While not required, attribution helps in:

**Academic or research work:**
```bibtex
@misc{woods2025pmpromptpatterns,
  author = {Woods, Andy},
  title = {PM-Prompt-Patterns},
  year = {2025},
  url = {https://github.com/awoods187/PM-Prompt-Patterns}
}
```

**Blog posts or articles:**
> Prompt patterns adapted from PM-Prompt-Patterns by Andy Woods

**Internal documentation:**
> Based on patterns from https://github.com/awoods187/PM-Prompt-Patterns

### What if I significantly modify a prompt?

Even with significant modifications, attribution is appreciated but not required. Consider:

**Option 1 - No attribution:** Perfectly acceptable under MIT
**Option 2 - Brief credit:** "Inspired by PM-Prompt-Patterns"
**Option 3 - Detailed credit:** "Based on [specific prompt] from PM-Prompt-Patterns with modifications for [your use case]"
