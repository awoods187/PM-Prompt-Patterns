# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to building a welcoming, collaborative community where product managers and AI practitioners can share knowledge, improve their craft, and build better products together.

This project thrives on diverse perspectives, rigorous technical discussion, and a shared commitment to production-quality work. We welcome contributors of all experience levels who are willing to learn, share openly, and maintain high standards.

## Our Standards

### How We Work Together

**We practice technical excellence:**
- Share real metrics and quantified results from production use
- Document both successes and failures honestly
- Question assumptions constructively and test hypotheses rigorously
- Provide evidence-based feedback on contributions
- Continuously improve prompts based on real-world learning

**We communicate with clarity and respect:**
- Ask questions to understand before critiquing
- Provide specific, actionable feedback on contributions
- Acknowledge good ideas regardless of who suggests them
- Admit when we don't know something or made a mistake
- Focus on ideas and evidence, not personalities

**We support each other's growth:**
- Help newcomers understand quality standards and testing methodology
- Share context and rationale behind technical decisions
- Mentor contributors on prompt engineering best practices
- Celebrate improvements in accuracy, cost reduction, and quality
- Point to resources and examples that can help

**We maintain professional conduct:**
- Treat everyone with respect regardless of experience level
- Welcome diverse perspectives on problem-solving approaches
- Give credit to original sources and inspirations
- Keep discussions focused on technical merit
- Assume good intent and seek clarification when uncertain

**We build in public:**
- Share our work openly under the MIT License
- Document our methodology so others can reproduce results
- Genericize examples to protect confidential information
- Contribute back improvements to the community
- Help others understand how to use and adapt our work

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:
- GitHub repository (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Code and documentation
- Example prompts and templates
- Community discussions
- Any public representation of the project

It also applies when representing the project in public spaces, such as:
- Conference presentations
- Blog posts or articles
- Social media discussions
- Professional networking events

## Enforcement

### Our Approach

We believe most issues can be resolved through direct, respectful communication. If you experience or witness behavior that doesn't align with this Code of Conduct:

**First, try direct communication:**
- Politely point out the issue if you're comfortable doing so
- Assume good intent - misunderstandings happen
- Focus on the specific behavior, not the person
- Suggest a better approach

**If that doesn't work, escalate:**
- Contact project maintainers by opening an issue marked [Private] or emailing directly
- Provide specific details about what happened
- Include links to relevant discussions or interactions
- Explain how it violates community standards

### Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:
- Clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior
- Taking fair and appropriate action in response to violations
- Removing, editing, or rejecting contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct
- Communicating decisions and rationale when actions are taken
- Applying standards consistently across all contributors

### Enforcement Actions

Depending on the situation, maintainers may:

**For minor issues or first occurrences:**
- Provide private feedback explaining the issue
- Request an edit or apology
- Offer guidance on better approaches
- Monitor for improvement

**For repeated or serious violations:**
- Issue a public warning
- Temporarily restrict participation (cooling-off period)
- Permanently ban from the project

All decisions will be:
- Based on evidence and community standards
- Applied consistently regardless of contributor status
- Explained with clear rationale
- Subject to appeal through direct maintainer contact

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by:
- Contributor Covenant 2.1
- Django Project Code of Conduct
- Python Community Code of Conduct
- Go Community Code of Conduct

It has been adapted to emphasize the technical rigor and production-quality standards that define this project.

## Updates

This Code of Conduct may evolve as the community grows. Significant changes will be announced in the repository and contributors will have a chance to provide feedback.

**Current version:** 1.0 (January 2025)

## Summary: Be Excellent to Each Other

At its core, this community is about:
- **Technical excellence** - Real metrics, rigorous testing, honest documentation
- **Mutual respect** - Treating everyone professionally regardless of experience
- **Continuous learning** - Sharing knowledge, asking questions, improving together
- **Open collaboration** - Building in public, giving credit, helping others succeed

If you keep these principles in mind, you're already aligned with our Code of Conduct.
