# Git History Rewrite - Completion Report

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Standardize all git commits to use GitHub privacy email (`awoods187@users.noreply.github.com`) instead of personal Gmail address (`andrew.scott.woods@gmail.com`).

---

## 📊 Initial Analysis

### Before Rewrite:
```
Author Emails:
- awoods187@users.noreply.github.com → ~20 commits (majority)
- andrew.scott.woods@gmail.com → 2 commits (merge commits)
- andy@cockroachlabs.com → 0 commits (NOT FOUND - already clean!)

Commits Using Gmail:
- 4472b9b - Merge pull request #3 from awoods187/prompt-library-v1
- 23e9d98 - Merge pull request #1 from awoods187/add-readme
```

**Good News:** No work email found in history!
